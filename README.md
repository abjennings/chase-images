**Chase-images**
================
A firefox extension to quickly download check images from Chase.

You can download the XPI file from the releases section.  In Firefox, go to Add-ons, click the gear icon and "Install add-on from file".

Once installed, you need to configure the destination directory for your images.

Then, log in to Chase and go to your account page, which should look like this:

click the "Chase" text in the add-on bar:

The extension will take control and download all check images on the visible page.  It downloads both debited check images and deposited check images.  It takes inventory of the destination directory first and skips any images that are already downloaded.
